<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Their is a lot of risks involved in the development of medical robots it is defined as an environment that involves risk, in this field the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, One major risk of medical robots is the financial risk this meant that the average price will increase from $3000 to about $6000 for a medical procedure furthermore is the installation costs which is about $1,390,000 this in turn will cause a snowball effect on the cost of medical procedures.The building of the medical robots through the intensive labour and resources used to develop theses medical robots is a big financial burden this also has another negative effect on the medical field as they are losing their jobs due to the fact that they are being replaced by robots. As the robots are better, cheaper and faster than humans. Another risk of medical robots is the fact that there is a possibility of human error and mechanical error. The idea of latency is the time it takes for the robot to carry out the surgeon's commands. It takes a few moments for the computer to translate the inputs to the robotic arm; this means that it is difficult for the surgeons to respond quickly to problems that occur during the operation. The Human error that occurs during medical procedure involving medical robots this also lead to the side effect of mechanical issues, having human error can have a lot of risks involved like the patient in cause unnecessary damage during surgery this can be also due to the build quality of the medical robot and having mechanical issues which lead to the problem of causing human error. Performance of the medical robot and the effect that it has on the patient when it is operating for example it is possible for the robot to cause permanent nerve damage due to the fact that they are being held in an unnatural position as required for some medical procedures. This in turns mean that the operator does not get a sense of feel for the amount of pressure that they are applying on the patient as they do not give tactile feedback that come from cutting directly into a patientâ€™s tissue, this can increase the risk of injury from hitting adjacent organs, furthermore the medical robot has the possibility of cause burns due to the electrical current. Training that comes into play to operate these medical robots, the training that is provided to surgeons new to medical robots is typically given an online course, a one day session at the manufacturing place and two supervised surgeries. In the end it is up to the hospital to decide whether the medical professional is ready to use the medical robot.Finally dexterity of the robot compared to humans where the robot will not be fatigued compared to a human being easily fatigued of the surgery is very long compared to a robot that will not be limited to fatigue but rather be limited to power, if the power runs out then test a risk that is involved in using medical robots. To sum this up  help to show the risks involved in this field of medical robotics
