<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

</ul><h4>Assistive vs controlled Robots<p><p></h4>
<p>There are two main types of robots that are being developed to aid the medical field. The first are remote controlled or user assistive robots. 
These assistive robots include the remote-control surgery robot that has seen great success and popularity in the last few years. With his surgeons can perform pinpoint accurate surgery from halfway across 
the globe. But this is not what most people envision when they think of robots, and certainly is not their limit. Beyond that would be fully automated
 robots. Now, fully automated robots are only capable of handling small jobs within the medical field. Hauser and Shaw talk about how they already
 have robots in the nursing field that can calibrate medicine intake for patient. They can deliver medicine to patients and even monitor patients
 when a nurse is unable to. This is already incredible work and has made a big impact on the medical field, giving them more tools to fight with,
 should a disaster like covid-19 happen again. But these tasks are simple for an automated robot. Fully automated robots could potentially one day
 reach the point of performing all the tasks a doctor could.<p>

<p>Robots are not cheap. There are already billions of dollars being funneled into their development, and while it may be worthwhile, as you cannot
 put a price on human lives, these funds arenâ€™t limitless. Which projects is worth all this funding? It comes down to the factors of risk vs reward.
 Remote controlled robots are much safer having a human on one end so should something go wrong; it would be carefully monitored and can easily be
 halted. On the other hand, a fully automated robot has much more potential and in the long run can save a lot of time and resources, as the number 
 of doctors available will always be very limited due to the harsh competitiveness when it comes to getting into the medical field. The remote
 assistive robots are much safer and easier for the time being and will cost much less to become widely available sooner. Where as a fully automated
 robot way take years and billions of dollars to undergo the vigorous testing needed to make sure they are safe enough to put a human life in their hands.</p>

<h4>Other options</h4>
<p>What might be another option should robots prove not to be the answer to the growing needs in the medical field. The obvious choice would be to 
keep going as is, manually performing tasks. But there can be improvements made in terms of efficiency. While Humans wont be able to have the accuracy
 or stability that a robot could provide it is possible to optimize the way that this field is run to reduce risks and increase success rates,
 as well as the number of patients that can be cared for. Another option is to work towards preventing disasters and outbreaks such as covid-19 from
 happening in the first place. Whether it is through the use of robots or not, prevention will always be better than needing a cure.</p>
