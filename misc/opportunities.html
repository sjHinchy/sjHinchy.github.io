</ul><h4><p>Robotics in Nursing<p></h4>
<p>Covid-19. When Covid-19 hit our medical care system was severely overwhelmed and we barely had enough nurses to keep up with the overwhelming amount of cases even though New Zealand was hit lightly compared to the rest of the world. Due to this there has been a high demand, world wide for robots that can assist healthcare workers, should a disaster like covid-19 happen again.  Robots have been looked into that are able to cover nurses admin side of their job so that they are more readily available for personal care. Should a outbreak of a similar caliber hit again nurses would be overwhelmed once again even more so with the immigration laws kicking out immigrants which make up a large portion of our nurse team. It is pivotal to further these robots which are able to ease some of the work load off of these essential workers. This catastrophe has pushed the development of medical robots.</p>

<h4><p>Tissue Grafting<p></h4>

<p style="font-size: 90%; padding-left:30px">“The main limitation of current bioreactors is that they poorly mimic the mechanical loadings that are experienced in the body. To produce clinically relevant grafts, future bioreactors will need to:

<p>This is where the robotics come in. By adding this tissue to a robot it will be able to replicate the constant stress, and strain that a human body would constantly be experiencing. This conditioned tissue could be tailor made to better fit patients. This has the potential to be very beneficial to the medical field and can only be achieved through with the help of robotics as it is a mix of some of the most complex aspects of both hardware and software.</p>
<h4><p>In Conclusion...<p></h4>
<p>Finally after looking into all the oppertunities that come with implementing robotics into the medical field, it seems that they have near limitless potential to save lives and make the lives of healthcare workers much easier, but the bigger the idea,
the bigger the risk, so it is our job to thoroughly test these ideas to ensure the best for our society.</p>
