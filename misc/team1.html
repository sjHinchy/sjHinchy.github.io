<p><h5>Ethical Reflection</p></h5>
<p>There is a major ethical issue with the development of medical robots firstly is the idea of the possible loss of personalized health care, for the most part this is about how that there is no sense of care in a robot compared to a human where robots are used to replace nurses and carers making humans feel likes objects, this in turn will reflect the idea of the loss of human contact where the robot has no feelings compared to a human doing things. An example of this is Alzheimers is more likely to be developed in people with a lack of social interactions, this means that it is more likely to happen to people that are being taken care of by medical robotics, reinforcing the idea that robots will result in the lack of social interaction with elderly people. A fix for this ethical concern, where robots will work alongside medical staff and caregivers, in such a method that will allow the best of both worlds. Another ethical concern is medical robots having the capabilities of being autonomous, controlled and their controllability. In such ways, who will or should control the robot, meaning that it will carry out tasks specified by the user. The idea of a “responsibility gap”, It is defined as if they can change the rules by which they act then not the humans but the robots should be held responsible for their autonomous decisions.” This is defined as that robots that would allow a human system be adapted to modulate robot behaviour. Patients may not be psychologically satisfied with non-human interactions this means that human emotional responses to machines may in fact impact their cognitive responses, this will result in that the perceived notions of real and metaphorical or difference may equate to less trust of the medical robot and lower willingness to share personal information. This will respond whether logical or not can subsequently result in a negative interaction , this has been seen throughout recent history such that negative interaction with healthcare workers or healthcare systems result in negative healthcare outcomes thus the emotional underpinning of successful doctor patient relations and communications. The developments of robots that interact with human store information on cloud servers mean that this data can be misused and data breaches can occur and personal information can be leaked thus data privacy and key ethical and legal issues furthermore this mean that data stored on the server are vulnerable to malicious actors and remote attacks. One final idea is the idea that Aristotle's virtue ethics is defined as morality assumes that we acquire virtue through practice. By practicing being honest, brave, just, generous, and so on, a person develops an honorable and moral character, this is reflected in  robots may have other motivations such as maximising profits, reducing patient interaction times, minimizing their potential liability, and allocating their resources according to their own needs and interests. This helps to summarize the ethics behind medical robots and the question that arise throughout modern society and how medical robots will affect everyday life.</p>
<p><h6>Personal Reflection</p></h6>
<p>Form my view, i believe that there should be an ethical concern for medical robots such that their is a lot of question to ask about them is the safety of the medical robots how safe is it to undergo surgery with a medical robot or how safe is it for medical robot to use for general health care and caregiving. Further is the development of robots where the ethical dimension of the robot should avoid a strictly functional approach, they should be able to simultaneously engage abstract principles and imagined potentialites furthermore there are other issues with the implementation of medical robots in the medical field since they are relatively new it would require surgeons a lot of practice to be able to have enough practice to operate the machinery. Another idea is the risks that it bring to the surgery table where i thin that the robot will not understand how much pressure they are applying when operating on a patient such as when the are clamping a artery or opening a cut, this amount of pressure could have significant consequences on the user such as damaged nerves, the ethics behind this though is about the long term damage that it could causes to the patient after the main issue is fixed. The financial ethics is a big factor in the use of medical robots this can be seen throughout the cost of manufacturing, installation, and operation of the machine this mean that the finance behind just using the robot to operate on a patient will significantly ramp up the price of the cost of the surgery, just alone the price of installing a medical robot is around 2 million, furthermore the cost of surgeries will almost amount to double the original price from an average of around 3 thousand dollars to about 6 thousand dollars. The idea of trust how much trust are we able to put into this new robotic technology we have to be sure that this is not just another instance of an over hyped technology in such cases we alter the social norms to suit the limitations of a new technology in this case a state of the are medical robot rather than making the designs of the robot more ergonomic before we begin mass use of this new technology this rapid new development of medical robots also highlights the fact that we are side-lining the development of more traditional alternative surgical techniques. This helps to further highlighight the ethical concerns that I have towards medical robots and how that has an effect on modern society and the potential concerns and questions that are brought to the light.</p>
